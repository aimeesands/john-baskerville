        <p>John Baskerville (1706-1775) was an English businessman whose
      entrepreneurial attentions included japanning and papier-mâché; he is,
      however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the
      design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his
      name.</p>

      "John likes to dress in womens clothes">

      <p>Baskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster
      in Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville
      printed works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist,
      printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly
      admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal
      Society of Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United
      States, where they were adopted for most federal government
      publishing.</p>

      <p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing,
      paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a
      smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also
      pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and
      generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

      <blockquote>
“Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became
        insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed
        to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had
        endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to
            be their true proportion.”

      <h2 id="the-typeface">The Typeface</h2><img alt=
      "John Baskerville typeface" src="images/jbfont.jpg">

      <p>Baskerville is a Transitional serif typeface designed by John
      Baskerville in 1757, positioned between the Old Style typefaces of
      William Caslon, and the modern styles of Giambattista Bodoni and Firmin
      Didot.</p>

      <p>The typeface is the result of Baskerville’s intent to improve upon the
      types of William Caslon. He increased the contrast between thick and thin
      strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis
      of rounded letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are
      more circular in shape, and the characters became more regular. These
      changes created a greater consistency in size and form.</p>

      <p>Baskerville’s work was criticized by jealous competitors and soon fell
      out of favour. Since the 1920s, however, numerous revivals of Baskerville
      have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries.
      Émigré released a popular revival of the typeface in 1996 called Mrs
      Eaves, named for Baskerville’s wife, Sarah Eaves. Baskerville represents
      the peak of Transitional type face design and bridges the gap between Old
      Style and Modern type design.</p>

        <h2 id="mrs-eaves">Mrs Eaves</h2>

        <p>Mrs Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became
        John Baskerville’s wife. As Baskerville was setting up his
        printing and type business, Mrs. Eaves moved in with him as a
        live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the
        death of her first husband, Mr. Eaves. Mrs Eaves is a revival
        of the types of English printer and punchcutter John
        Baskerville, and is related to contemporary Baskerville
        typefaces.</p>

        <p>Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves, cut by Zuzana Licko of Émigré,
        has a near vertical stress, departing from the Old Style model.
        Identifying characters, similar to Baskerville’s types, are the
        lowercase g with its open lower counter and swashlike ear. Both
        the roman and italic uppercase Q have a flowing swashlike tail.
        The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there is no serif
        at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W; and the
        uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial
        serif.</p>
